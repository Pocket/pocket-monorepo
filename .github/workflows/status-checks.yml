## Note that since this workflow uses Workflow Run changes will only be reflected once it is on the default branch

# Because we use conditional path filtering on all our workflows, but want to Require status checks to pass on Github, 
# we use a special status check job that we can require and will do the checking for us.
# We also use this because re-usable workflows can not be targeted for Github Required Status Checks as of 8/15/2024
